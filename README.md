## ***`How To Use`***

1. clone this repo, host on ANY site hoster, static or not, (Netlify/Render/Cloudflare Pages/Github Pages/CodeSandbox/Vercel/Heroku/etc.) and deploy the project. if you plan to deploy with Vercel, you do not have to clone this repo, and the button for quick deploy is right below these instructions
2. deploy
3. use freely!

alternatively: 

1. download the offline file either from this repo or from the dropdown menu in Helios (`Helios-Offline.html`)
3. open the file in your browser (broser in a browser haha).
4. go crazy!

***Note: this file can not be blocked unless your admin physically deletes the file off of your device, which was the main point of Helios, and i STRONGLY recomend doing this.**

alternatively alternatively:

1. copy and the entirerty of `Helios-Offline.html`, or copy `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` seperartly
2. visit ANY online WYSIWYG HTML editor (Webmaker/CodeBeautify/OnlineHtmlEditor/Codepen/etc.)
3. paste and replace `<style>` and `<script>` tags where appropriate (not nessasary if you copied `Helios-Offline.html`)
4. enjoy uncesored local browsing!

***Note: This last method will create a temporary Helios instance, and you will have to repeat these steps everytime you close or reset the tabs, unless you download the HTML**

alternatively alternatively alternatively:

1. click on the green code button in this repo
2. click on the codespaces tab
3. create a new codespace by clicking the "Create codespace on main" button
4. navagate to the terminal near the bottom and run `python3 -m http.server 8080`
5. click the "Make Public" option in the popup that shows up, or go to the Ports tab, right click on 8080, hover on "Port Visiblity" and click "Public"
6. click on the Forwarded Address in the Ports tab. it should look something like `https://<your-repo-name>-<random-id>.<your-username>.github.dev`
7. boom! use your temorary link for its full 30 minute lifetime!

***Note: To extend the life of your codespace link visit your profile settings, go to the Codespaces tab, and change the "Default idle timeout" time from 30 minutes to 240 minutes, which is the maximum time.**
